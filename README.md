<h3>My story with Computer Science</h3>
My name is Sara. I am a CS student at the University of Genoa, in Italy. 
I choose Computer Science because I was interested in how can we communicate with and through machines. Since I'm finishing my Bachelor's Degree, I've explored a fair number of fields and languages for CS's applications.
