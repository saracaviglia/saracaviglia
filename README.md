<h3>My story with Computer Science</h3>
My name is Sara. I am a CS student at the University of Genoa, in Italy. 
I choose Computer Science because I was interested in how can we communicate with and through machines. Since I'm finishing my Bachelor's Degree, I've explored a fair number of fields and languages for CS's applications.
I started learning about CS in high school and when we started coding I fell in love. In my third year I decided what I wanted to major in. During the fourth year, right before the lockdown, I took part in a stage offered by the University of Genoa: we learnt a lot about the course and about ourselves (and some Python too). After my final exam I was excited to finally study what I really enjoyed, and not what I had to.
<h3>My future</h3>
This year I will (hopefully) get my Bachelor's, then I'd like to stay here in Genoa and get my Master's in Computer Science. The area I would like to study the most is Artificial Intelligence, a subject that really permeates our lives more and more everyday. After that, I would like to work in the same field. However, maybe, there will be a Master or a course that I will attend: I don't kwnow what the future has for me in store.

- C 
- C++ 
- Python
